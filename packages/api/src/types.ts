/**
 * Type-only exports for React Native / Expo
 *
 * This file uses `export type` to ensure no runtime dependencies are pulled in.
 * Safe to import in environments where Node.js modules aren't available.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import type { AppRouter } from '@seawatts/api/types';
 * ```
 */

export type { AppRouter } from './root';
